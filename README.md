# PLEROMA-MIGRATOR

A horrific group of scripts that can help you copy your fedi posts to a new account. If the server's Pleroma and you have direct access to the database, you can even preserve post dates.

See invididual script's --help messages, with pleroma-migrator.sh being the one that combines them all for you.
